Bash to the moon.

Bashed Potato aims at making standard bash more usable, more useful and more importantly, more fun to be in!

It's comporised of configurations and tweeks to standard packages, as well as leveraging on external packages if you choose to include.

It's designed to be fully customisable while allowing for receiving updates from upstream.
